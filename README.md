<h2>About Pterodactyl-Manager</h2>

<p>A Discord bot developed by Rafale Development makes it easier to handle Pterodactyl game servers. This bot is ideal for server administrators and owners that require a quick way to handle activities like starting, pausing, restarting, checking the status of the server, and tracking usage.

The bot was created specifically for servers that use Pterodactyl as their game server management panel. It uses both the Discord API and Pterodactyl API client. Since our bot is distributed under the permissive MIT licence, users are allowed to alter and personalise it as they see fit.
